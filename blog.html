                <h2>Storytelling in UX</h2>

                <p><b>On Perspective</b><br>
                <i>“You could use the perspective of the city itself [when telling a story], showing how all the time spent trying to park adds up across the population.” Pg. 334</i></p>
                <p>When telling stories, we often get caught up in the point of view in the characters, so much so that we occasionally neglect other forms of perspective. I appreciated this example of a less conventional perspective of a city itself; many of my favorite stories treat the setting as a character in itself, whether it’s the cyberpunk atmosphere of Blade Runner (that tells a story about hypercapitalism / the effects of climate change) or the southern bayou of True Detective S1 (showing the results of a neglected community). In this example, using the city as an example of trying to reform car parking structure is great, when one considers all the physical space that parking garages/parking lots take up in a city VS. the amount of physical space taken up by public transit.

                <p><b>On Confessional Tales</b><br>
                    <i>“This might be a risky strategy. After all, if you are an expert, shouldn’t you be sharing that expertise, not your own problems and personal experiences?” Pg. 338</i></p>
                    <p>One of the most important factors of storytelling these days is ethos. It can be easy to separate yourself from the story you are trying to tell, but the best stories, in my opinion, portray the author in them in some way or another; whether it’s by describing something that actually happened to them or acknowledging through fiction something that affects them in their real life. It can be risky when trying to sell a product to showcase yourself as having a problem. But people are more affected if someone is telling a passionate story that happened to them vs. something that happened to a fictional character. It also presents an opportunity for the author or presenter to be humble and bring a humanistic touch to their work, which immediately can get the audience on your side.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><b>On Historical Context</b><br>
                        <i>“Historical context can be a small or quick reference to something that the audience might recognize, either specifically (like the Vietnam War) or metaphorically: “Back when the world was young,” or, “Back when dialing a phone meant using an actual dial.” Pg. 360</i></p>
                        <p>Similarly to my thoughts on perspective, using the frame of historical context can be one of the things that makes a story the most effective. By using historical context you can quickly set the mood of a story. One of the examples above is the Vietnam War — when a story is set during this period, there is immediately a sense of urgency and drama created due to the understanding that not only the war was happing, but large cultural shifts as well from Civil Rights to the Space Race. This, vs. setting a story during the 00’s, where personal technology is extremely prevalent, changing the world completely with computers, cellphones, and the internet (it’s a lot harder to frame a horror movie where a protagonist can’t access the phone in an age where everyone has a phone on them, for example).
