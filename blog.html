            <h2>Interaction Relabelling</h2>
            <h4><i>Oct 27, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
                <p><i>“Focusing on ease of use tends to encourage a narrow view of what ‘use’ is with respect to technology, emphasising efficiency and productivity over exploration or curiosity” (pg. 1)</i></p>
                <p>Over the summer I was in an internship program where I, as a designer, had to work with marketers and engineers to develop a product. This quote brings to mind the dissonance between these three branches of a business — the designer might want to create something unique that the marketer does not think is sellable. Or perhaps the marketer has a grandiose idea for what the product should be that the engineer can’t feasibly build. In the instance of this quote, focusing on an ease of use over an aesthetic represents to me, most of all, the conflicts that might arise between an engineer and a designer. Engineering is often about coming up with elegant and simple solutions that do indeed emphasize efficiency and productivity. But then we have designers, whose whole job is to create the aesthetic of the thing, which could be visually beautiful but not as simple or straightforward. The answer to “what is good design” lies somewhere between these two viewpoints.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“It is the resulting richness of gestures, not the metaphor that is important. In fact, designs resulting from relabelling the toy gun need not be visually related to a firearm at all.” (pg. 2)
                </i></p>
                <p>I found the exercise of remapping a gun very amusing, and interesting. There are lots of different kinds of machines and contraptions that the human race has created over our existence on earth. Trying to take interactive elements and give them new, and sometimes strange purposes can create some fun ideas for new modes of interaction. I am reminded of a movie I saw recently where there is a great battle happening. In order to breach the city walls, the army below turns palm trees into catapults, wherein they pull back the palm trees with ropes and warriors climb up to the canopy of the tree before subsequently being launched over the city gates by releasing the rope. Is this perhaps remapping the use of a tree to give it a new purpose? Not sure why this came to mind but I think so.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“This is the central aspect of designing for extreme characters: the extremes make one realize that the way things are is not necessarily the only way. They allow one to think of the richness of aesthetics, interactions and roles that electronic products could offer next to the narrow, existing ones.” (pg. 7)
                </i></p>For our design studio this semester, we are developing a smarter form of street sign. There’s a lot of questions about how to integrate the signs with the technology in our phones through apps/AR/etc. Something I keep thinking about, however, is people who don’t have smartphones. I realize that in the USA in 2022 it’s quite rare for an adult to not have a smartphone — but I know that some people don’t! This is an example of an extreme character to design for — one that is becoming more and more extreme as the years go by. I wonder how future design will consider these people; or if it will at all.

            <h2>MIDTERM</h2>
            <h4><i>Oct 20, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
              Things are a little different in the 31st century. All that forged a normal life for those of you in the past, be it the material (capital) or the metaphysical (identity) are no longer known or have taken new meaning. Once we took to the stars, growth beyond these concepts was to be expected.
              Rarely do you find societies living a sedentary existence planetside like in the old days. Rather, we prefer to explore the ever-expanding universe, collecting materials from celestial objects with a conservationist’s touch. We still need each other to survive, though, so community is as important as ever – it’s rare that anyone travels alone.<br><br>
              
              Technology has played a large part in our galactic life; automation and 3D printing allow us to create anything we want, from our spaceships to the clothes on our back. We value, above all else, ingenuity – and seek out the rarest and strangest materials in the universe to create everything around us. Our creations are how we forge our ‘identity’ in this brave new universe.<br><br>
              
              Of the rarest materials, Absorbetium is the most coveted. Its unique aesthetic properties propel the bearers to stardom, making it highly sought after for social status. It’s also an incredibly powerful healing element, which is often overshadowed by its beauty. <br><br>
              
              And so we meet Danix, a kind and gentle human who captains a spaceship with his closest friends, searching for rare materials throughout the galaxy. His love, Indu, keeps him grounded in this ever expanding abyss of exploration. Though they value each others friendships, each individuals outlook and goals in life are beginning to shift. This causes unrest amongst the group.<br><br>
              
              The crew technician, Jordy, neglects his duty to do his routine inspection on the stream line capacitor. Not knowing this, Indu begins the startup sequence of the machine, it malfunctions and throws Indu to the ground. Indu is mortally wounded. The team is able to stabilize her for the time being but she will succumb to her injuries if she is not treated soon. Danix demands to know the cause of the malfunction. With the routine schedule destroyed an none of the other crew members accepting responsibility over the malfunction,  Danix begins to question the trust and loyalty of his team.<br><br>
              
              To try and save Indu, the crew visits the nearest space station to put her in a hospital and find supplies – but her condition is terminal due to the compound she was exposed to. They are unable to find any medicines to help her, but they are overheard asking for help by a man named George, who emerges from the shadows to introduce himself.<br><br>
              “There’s one thing that can save your Indu,” he says, “Absorbetium.”<br><br>
              “I can help you find it,” he offers, “If you can get me off this station.”<br><br>
              Danix’s crew is suspicious of this lone traveler (they are rare in this universe where everyone has a crew and home), but not knowing what else to do, and frustrated with his crew, he ignores their warnings and accepts George’s help in searching for the Absorbetium.<br><br>
              
              The symbol for absorbetium was created as a map to finding the one source of the mineral in the universe; very few know this information. Over time the original meaning has been forgotten, so it is only a symbol representing it & the status symbol of ownership.<br><br>
              
              After Danix has discovered and extracted the Absorbetium, he is cornered by a rival space gang. The gang doesn’t care about Danix’s need to heal Indu, they want the Absorbetium for themselves. Their greed for fashion and status supersedes (スーパーシーズ) their empathy for others. There’s no way for everyone to come out of this unscathed. (アンスケースド) Unwilling to surrender the Absorbetium, Danix kills the rival gang and escapes with the Absorbetium.<br><br>
              
              Danix struggles with the guilt of killing other human beings to save his love. He continually wonders if there would have been another way. Noticing that Danix is occupied with his regret, George takes the opportunity to steal the Absorbetium, and escape from the ship. After realizing he has been betrayed, Danix is furious.. But out of options. <br><br>
              
              Danix returns to the space station empty handed, defeated. Hoping for a miracle to bring Indu back from near death, he is optimistic that he can find George, or another source of Absorbetium. Indu asks how he has been doing, and closes her eyes slowly as she listens to his story, which becomes their very last conversation. In Danix’s arms, Indu, still looking stunning, is now gone forever. Danix lays a flower next to Indu, thinking about how happy they were when they found this flower on Earth together last year. “I wish I could take your place,” Danix whispers. <br><br>
              
              Repulsive thoughts race through his mind. His body trembles with anger, his eyes are filled with tears. Danix cannot help but wonder: if there is no salvation, why bother being a saint?

            <h2>Vogler's Writer's Journey</h2>
            <h4><i>Sept 29, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
                <p><i>“Such stories are accurate models of the workings of the human mind, true maps of the psyche. They are psychologically valid and emotionally realistic even when they portray fantastic, impossible, or unreal events” (pg. 4)</i></p>
                <p>I appreciated this bit of insight because, more than anything, for me, emotion drives a story. A story can be about the simplest thing – a boy and a girl meeting on a train – or the most complex – a detective entering a dream world to discover the deepest evils of the earth – but what will always make it effective is if the emotions of the story ring true. Emotions can also be what causes a story to cross borders and boundaries, such as the S. Korean film “Parasite” that ended up winning grand prizes in western film awards. Because the emotion of the characters hit home for so many people in a time of poverty and climate change (two things explored by the film), it didn’t matter what language it was in – it connected.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“Saloons and seedy bars seem to be good places for these transactions. Countless Westerns take the hero to a saloon where his manhood and determination are tested, and where friends and villains are introduced. Bars are also useful to the hero for obtaining information, for learning the new rules that apply to the Special World.” (pg. 13)
                </i></p>
                <p>This passage refers to the “tests, allies, and enemies” part of the hero’s journey, and what it immediately brings to mind is… playing tabletop games, for Dungeons & Dragons. Gamifying the hero’s journey is one of the key aspects of D&D; for the players, they are constantly searching for tests, allies, and enemies in order to progress in the story and build their character. When playing dungeons & dragons, the players explore a world created/controlled by the dungeon master. Oftentimes when arriving in a new town, the first action the players will take is seeking out the tavern in order to meet the local town members and gossip with the bartender. It is often the starting point for the players to find quests, allies, and potential enemies, and embark on the adventures awaiting within.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“The structure should not call attention to itself, nor should it be followed too precisely.” (pg. 19)
                </i></p>I disagree with the sentiment presented here. One of the most clear-cut examples of The Hero’s Journey we have today is The Wachowski’s The Matrix, which directly calls out the structure of the hero’s journey many times. From Neo literally receiving “a call” that serves as his “call to adventure.” Every plot beat in The Matrix follows the Hero’s Journey to the tee, and it is precisely this kind of meta approach that makes it so effective, considering the other themes of The Matrix concern living in a fabricated reality. Later films in the Matrix francheise continue to call out the structure directly, specifically in The Matrix: Ressurections. Not only is the title a reference to the Hero's Journey, but Resurrections also breaks down the original "Matrix" film through the eyes of the viewer in an interesting and dense way.

                  turns things political – jfk tries to smooth things over, dodging her inquiries and statements. She
                  keeps at him. JFK is already on the fence about some of these things but his advisors and notably
                  lyndon johnson are pressuring him to keep the war on.</p>

                <p>3. Climax</p>
                <p>– until he breaks. She accuses him of inviting her just to “look progressive” and tells the story of
                  her friends who have died both in the war and domestically, appealing to his better judgement, finally
                </p>

                <p>4. Falling action</p>
                <p>Her wit having won him over, JFK stands up to LBJ to pull all the troops out of vietnam, and drafts
                  his version of the civil rights act.</p>

                <p>5. Denoument</p>
                <p>We are shown a future where this conversation had been allowed to take place should JFK had not been
                  assassinated – and the implications that it would lead to historic black leaders such as MLK and
                  Malcolm X also not getting assassinated, a better world where nixon nor reagan would’ve been allowed
                  into power :)</p>

                <p><b>From User to Character</b><br></p>
                <p><i>“Angela is described in such an anonymous way that it never becomes clear why she acts as she
                    does. She could be anyone or actually no one.” (pg. 3)</i></p>
                <p>This is an important piece of insight to keep in mind when crafting a character. Sometimes, in order
                  to create a character the audience can relate to, writers will make someone who is too vague; but this
                  will make the audience have the opposite reaction. Just because someone’s situation isn’t necessarily
                  relatable, the emotion the person feels when going through a situation can be universal. Therefore it
                  is important to give all characters a sense of personality and unique agency in order to make someone
                  truly “relatable.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“Film script writing has a lot of rules established taking into account the transformation from
                    paper to screen. One such rule is only to describe what can be seen.” (pg. 4)</i></p>
                <p>I’ve taken a few screenwriting courses and one of the first pieces of advice given is “show, don’t
                  tell.” Relying too heavily on narration of events can seem like you are telling the audience how to
                  feel. If you, instead, show them the event, you can shape their emotional reaction in a different way.
                  It’s not just limited to screenwriting – print can also use the “show, don’t tell” rule by describing
                  actions rather than emotions. For example, saying “She was scared of heights” is not quite as
                  effective as “When she looked down, she became sick to her stomach.”
                </p>

                <p><i>“To describe the user as a rounded character brings a focus on the user into the design process.”
                    (pg. 6)</i></p>
                <p>I appreciated this bit of insight since we are focusing on the “human” part of “human-computer
                  interaction.” Everyone is a unique individual with their own sets of ideals, skills, and
                  methodologies. Identifying a unique perspective and applying it to your designs can help a designer
                  find specific problems that they might not otherwise find.

            <h2>What If...?</h2>
            <h4><i>Sept 15, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Yamadonga on DS9</b><br>
              <p>Star Trek is a great series because any and every crossover makes sense, including the one I’ve just
                considered which is Deep Space 9 and the 2007 Tollywood mass film “Yamadonga” (trans. “The Thief of
                Yama”).
              </p>
              <p>We find Raja, the Thief of Yama himself, suddenly sucked through some kind of time wormhole from 21st
                century Hyderabad; he emerges on Deep Space 9 (the Federation-controlled space station between the Delta
                Wormhole and Bajor) in the 24th century! Keeping in mind that Raja has already died, gone to hell, taken
                over, and subsequently been brought back to life, we know that he is quick to adapt to new and strange
                situations. Perhaps he thinks he’s in Hell again, though it looks quite a bit different now. Classic
                fish-out-of-water antics ensue as the crew of DS9 tries to figure out how this 21st century trickster
                got here. He’s impressed by food replicators. He finds the futuristic fashions drab. Looking out at
                space is always a remarkable sight! Always a hustler, Raja would likely find his way to Quark’s Bar and
                start scamming the Dabo tables. Quark would notice and they would team up to rip off customers and
                gamblers, much to the disappointment of Odo (chief of security.)
              </p>
              <p>He would do well at DS9 in general, befriending crew members and civilians (the ones he didn’t cheat
                out of their latinum) alike. There would be at least one chase/fight scene, maybe where he takes down a
                criminal of some kind to earn the trust of the DS9 crew; or maybe an acrobatic clash of titans between
                him and Major Kira. Since Raja’s been transported from a masala film there also would be a dance scene
                with very little context or relationship to the overarching story.
              </p>
              <p>Eventually, the crew would solve the time crisis and find a way to get Raja back home to his new wife,
                with all the gold-pressed latinum he earned scamming at Quark’s.

              <p><b>What if...? </b></p><br>
              <ul>
                <li>...the black plague wiped out  100% of Europe (instead of the estimated 30-60%)?</li>
                <li>...Antonin Scalia had been assassinated in 1999?</li>
                <li><b>...JFK <i>hadn’t</i> been assassinated?</b></li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>My alternate history where JFK was allowed to live would follow two different characters: JFK himself
                and a somewhat-fictionalized version of Elaine Brown (who, in real life, would be the chairwoman for the
                Black Panther party in the 70’s). While the struggle for Civil Rights and the Vietnam War raged, Elaine
                would appeal her grievances to JFK via letter; he would invite her of them to the White House where a
                stage-play type story would take place between the president and Elaine; where she would convince him to
                end the cold war and create more social justice reforms ~ countless lives saved and Nixon never getting
                elected ~

            <h2>Storytelling in UX</h2>
            <h4><i>Sept. 9, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <p><b>On Perspective</b><br>
              <i>“You could use the perspective of the city itself [when telling a story], showing how all the time
                spent trying to park adds up across the population.” Pg. 334</i></p>
            <p>When telling stories, we often get caught up in the point of view in the characters, so much so that we
              occasionally neglect other forms of perspective. I appreciated this example of a less conventional
              perspective of a city itself; many of my favorite stories treat the setting as a character in itself,
              whether it’s the cyberpunk atmosphere of Blade Runner (that tells a story about hypercapitalism / the
              effects of climate change) or the southern bayou of True Detective S1 (showing the results of a neglected
              community). In this example, using the city as an example of trying to reform car parking structure is
              great, when one considers all the physical space that parking garages/parking lots take up in a city VS.
              the amount of physical space taken up by public transit.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>On Confessional Tales</b><br>
              <i>“This might be a risky strategy. After all, if you are an expert, shouldn’t you be sharing that
                expertise, not your own problems and personal experiences?” Pg. 338</i></p>
            <p>One of the most important factors of storytelling these days is ethos. It can be easy to separate
              yourself from the story you are trying to tell, but the best stories, in my opinion, portray the author in
              them in some way or another; whether it’s by describing something that actually happened to them or
              acknowledging through fiction something that affects them in their real life. It can be risky when trying
              to sell a product to showcase yourself as having a problem. But people are more affected if someone is
              telling a passionate story that happened to them vs. something that happened to a fictional character. It
              also presents an opportunity for the author or presenter to be humble and bring a humanistic touch to
              their work, which immediately can get the audience on your side.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>On Historical Context</b><br>
              <i>“Historical context can be a small or quick reference to something that the audience might recognize,
                either specifically (like the Vietnam War) or metaphorically: “Back when the world was young,” or, “Back
                when dialing a phone meant using an actual dial.” Pg. 360</i></p>
            <p>Similarly to my thoughts on perspective, using the frame of historical context can be one of the things
              that makes a story the most effective. By using historical context you can quickly set the mood of a
              story. One of the examples above is the Vietnam War — when a story is set during this period, there is
              immediately a sense of urgency and drama created due to the understanding that not only the war was
              happing, but large cultural shifts as well from Civil Rights to the Space Race. This, vs. setting a story
              during the 00’s, where personal technology is extremely prevalent, changing the world completely with
              computers, cellphones, and the internet (it’s a lot harder to frame a horror movie where a protagonist
              can’t access the phone in an age where everyone has a phone on them, for example).
