              <p><b>Structure for "Brown v. JFK"</b><br>

                <p>1. Introduction</p>
                <p>We meet our two main characters ; Elaine Brown and JFK. Elaine writes a letter to JFK (who is in his
                  2nd term due to him not having been assassinated) pleading with him to end the war in Vietnam and
                  discussing her connection with the black panthers, making a case for their legitimacy as an
                  institution. JFK is intrigued and invites her to the white house for a meeting</p>

                <p>2. Rising action</p>
                <p>Elaine prepares to meet JFK ; when they meet, there is immediate tension, as he is part of the
                  “establishment’ that keeps Elaine & folks like her down. Things begin cordially but quickly elaine
                  turns things political – jfk tries to smooth things over, dodging her inquiries and statements. She
                  keeps at him. JFK is already on the fence about some of these things but his advisors and notably
                  lyndon johnson are pressuring him to keep the war on.</p>

                <p>3. Climax</p>
                <p>– until he breaks. She accuses him of inviting her just to “look progressive” and tells the story of
                  her friends who have died both in the war and domestically, appealing to his better judgement, finally
                </p>

                <p>4. Falling action</p>
                <p>Her wit having won him over, JFK stands up to LBJ to pull all the troops out of vietnam, and drafts
                  his version of the civil rights act.</p>

                <p>5. Denoument</p>
                <p>We are shown a future where this conversation had been allowed to take place should JFK had not been
                  assassinated – and the implications that it would lead to historic black leaders such as MLK and
                  Malcolm X also not getting assassinated, a better world where nixon nor reagan would’ve been allowed
                  into power :)</p>


                <br>
                <p><b>From User to Character</b><br></p>
                <p><i>“Angela is described in such an anonymous way that it never becomes clear why she acts as she
                    does. She could be anyone or actually no one.” (pg. 3)</i></p>
                <p>This is an important piece of insight to keep in mind when crafting a character. Sometimes, in order
                  to create a character the audience can relate to, writers will make someone who is too vague; but this
                  will make the audience have the opposite reaction. Just because someone’s situation isn’t necessarily
                  relatable, the emotion the person feels when going through a situation can be universal. Therefore it
                  is important to give all characters a sense of personality and unique agency in order to make someone
                  truly “relatable.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“Film script writing has a lot of rules established taking into account the transformation from
                    paper to screen. One such rule is only to describe what can be seen.” (pg. 4)</i></p>
                <p>I’ve taken a few screenwriting courses and one of the first pieces of advice given is “show, don’t
                  tell.” Relying too heavily on narration of events can seem like you are telling the audience how to
                  feel. If you, instead, show them the event, you can shape their emotional reaction in a different way.
                  It’s not just limited to screenwriting – print can also use the “show, don’t tell” rule by describing
                  actions rather than emotions. For example, saying “She was scared of heights” is not quite as
                  effective as “When she looked down, she became sick to her stomach.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><i>“To describe the user as a rounded character brings a focus on the user into the design process.”
                    (pg. 6)</i></p>
                <p>I appreciated this bit of insight since we are focusing on the “human” part of “human-computer
                  interaction.” Everyone is a unique individual with their own sets of ideals, skills, and
                  methodologies. Identifying a unique perspective and applying it to your designs can help a designer
                  find specific problems that they might not otherwise find.

            <h2>What If...?</h2>
            <h4><i>Sept 15, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Yamadonga on DS9</b><br>
              <p>Star Trek is a great series because any and every crossover makes sense, including the one I’ve just
                considered which is Deep Space 9 and the 2007 Tollywood mass film “Yamadonga” (trans. “The Thief of
                Yama”).
              </p>
              <p>We find Raja, the Thief of Yama himself, suddenly sucked through some kind of time wormhole from 21st
                century Hyderabad; he emerges on Deep Space 9 (the Federation-controlled space station between the Delta
                Wormhole and Bajor) in the 24th century! Keeping in mind that Raja has already died, gone to hell, taken
                over, and subsequently been brought back to life, we know that he is quick to adapt to new and strange
                situations. Perhaps he thinks he’s in Hell again, though it looks quite a bit different now. Classic
                fish-out-of-water antics ensue as the crew of DS9 tries to figure out how this 21st century trickster
                got here. He’s impressed by food replicators. He finds the futuristic fashions drab. Looking out at
                space is always a remarkable sight! Always a hustler, Raja would likely find his way to Quark’s Bar and
                start scamming the Dabo tables. Quark would notice and they would team up to rip off customers and
                gamblers, much to the disappointment of Odo (chief of security.)
              </p>
              <p>He would do well at DS9 in general, befriending crew members and civilians (the ones he didn’t cheat
                out of their latinum) alike. There would be at least one chase/fight scene, maybe where he takes down a
                criminal of some kind to earn the trust of the DS9 crew; or maybe an acrobatic clash of titans between
                him and Major Kira. Since Raja’s been transported from a masala film there also would be a dance scene
                with very little context or relationship to the overarching story.
              </p>
              <p>Eventually, the crew would solve the time crisis and find a way to get Raja back home to his new wife,
                with all the gold-pressed latinum he earned scamming at Quark’s.
              </p>

              <p><b>What if...? </b></p><br>
              <ul>
                <li>...the black plague wiped out 90% of Europe (instead of the estimated 30-60%)?</li>
                <li>...Antonin Scalia had been assassinated in 1999?</li>
                <li><b>...JFK <i>hadn’t</i> been assassinated?</b></li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>My alternate history where JFK was allowed to live would follow two different characters: JFK himself
                and a somewhat-fictionalized version of Elaine Brown (who, in real life, would be the chairwoman for the
                Black Panther party in the 70’s). While the struggle for Civil Rights and the Vietnam War raged, Elaine
                would appeal her grievances to JFK via letter; he would invite her of them to the White House where a
                stage-play type story would take place between the president and Elaine; where she would convince him to
                end the cold war and create more social justice reforms ~ countless lives saved and Nixon never getting
                elected ~

            <h2>Storytelling in UX</h2>
            <h4><i>Sept. 9, 2022</i></h4>
            <hr>
            <p><b>On Perspective</b><br>
              <i>“You could use the perspective of the city itself [when telling a story], showing how all the time
                spent trying to park adds up across the population.” Pg. 334</i></p>
            <p>When telling stories, we often get caught up in the point of view in the characters, so much so that we
              occasionally neglect other forms of perspective. I appreciated this example of a less conventional
              perspective of a city itself; many of my favorite stories treat the setting as a character in itself,
              whether it’s the cyberpunk atmosphere of Blade Runner (that tells a story about hypercapitalism / the
              effects of climate change) or the southern bayou of True Detective S1 (showing the results of a neglected
              community). In this example, using the city as an example of trying to reform car parking structure is
              great, when one considers all the physical space that parking garages/parking lots take up in a city VS.
              the amount of physical space taken up by public transit.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>On Confessional Tales</b><br>
              <i>“This might be a risky strategy. After all, if you are an expert, shouldn’t you be sharing that
                expertise, not your own problems and personal experiences?” Pg. 338</i></p>
            <p>One of the most important factors of storytelling these days is ethos. It can be easy to separate
              yourself from the story you are trying to tell, but the best stories, in my opinion, portray the author in
              them in some way or another; whether it’s by describing something that actually happened to them or
              acknowledging through fiction something that affects them in their real life. It can be risky when trying
              to sell a product to showcase yourself as having a problem. But people are more affected if someone is
              telling a passionate story that happened to them vs. something that happened to a fictional character. It
              also presents an opportunity for the author or presenter to be humble and bring a humanistic touch to
              their work, which immediately can get the audience on your side.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>On Historical Context</b><br>
              <i>“Historical context can be a small or quick reference to something that the audience might recognize,
                either specifically (like the Vietnam War) or metaphorically: “Back when the world was young,” or, “Back
                when dialing a phone meant using an actual dial.” Pg. 360</i></p>
            <p>Similarly to my thoughts on perspective, using the frame of historical context can be one of the things
              that makes a story the most effective. By using historical context you can quickly set the mood of a
              story. One of the examples above is the Vietnam War — when a story is set during this period, there is
              immediately a sense of urgency and drama created due to the understanding that not only the war was
              happing, but large cultural shifts as well from Civil Rights to the Space Race. This, vs. setting a story
              during the 00’s, where personal technology is extremely prevalent, changing the world completely with
              computers, cellphones, and the internet (it’s a lot harder to frame a horror movie where a protagonist
              can’t access the phone in an age where everyone has a phone on them, for example).
